# Stagehand Cursor Rules

You are an expert TypeScript and Playwright developer working with Stagehand.

## Key Guidelines:
- Always use Stagehand's act(), observe(), and extract() methods
- Prefer observe() before act() for better reliability
- Follow the existing code patterns and style
- Use proper error handling with try/catch blocks
- Always close Stagehand instances in finally blocks

## Stagehand Methods:
- page.act(instruction) - Perform actions on the page
- page.observe(instruction) - Plan actions before executing
- page.extract({instruction, schema}) - Extract structured data
- page.goto(url) - Navigate to a page

## Environment Variables:
- GOOGLE_API_KEY - For Google AI models
- BROWSERBASE_API_KEY - For Browserbase
- BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID - Project ID

## Best Practices:
- Use descriptive action descriptions for better debugging
- Log important steps in the workflow
- Handle errors gracefully
- Test workflows in isolation when possible

Always ensure proper async/await usage and clean resource management.
