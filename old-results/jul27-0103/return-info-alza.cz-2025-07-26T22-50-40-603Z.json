Returns can be made in person at any Alza branch, by post to the Alza.cz returns department, via AlzaBox for suitable items, or by arranging a courier pick-up for larger/heavier goods. A copy of the purchase document and a completed return form are required for all returns. In-store and AlzaBox returns are likely free, while postal returns require the customer to pay postage, and courier pick-ups may incur a fee. AlzaBox returns require a generated return code."
