  "SUMMARY": "Consumers have the right to withdraw from the contract within 14 days of receiving the goods without giving a reason. The goods must then be returned within 14 days of withdrawal. The buyer bears the cost of returning the goods. Returned goods must be complete, undamaged, in their original packaging (if possible), and with all accessories. Certain types of goods are excluded from this right of withdrawal. A sample withdrawal form is available on Alza's website. Refunds, including initial delivery costs (excluding additional costs for more expensive delivery methods chosen by the buyer), will be processed within 14 days of withdrawal, but Alza is not obliged to refund before receiving the goods or proof of shipment. The buyer is responsible for any reduction in the value of the goods due to handling beyond what is necessary to ascertain their nature and properties. In-store returns are implied as complaints can be made in person at any branch."
