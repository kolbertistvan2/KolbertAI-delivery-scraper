  "SUMMARY": "DELIVERY OPTIONS: Pevex offers home delivery throughout Croatia and a free 'Click & Collect' in-store pickup service available at 31 locations. Parcel shop and parcel locker delivery are not available.\nPRICING & PROVIDERS: Home delivery costs are calculated at checkout based on order weight and delivery location; specific price tiers or free shipping thresholds are not listed. The courier companies used are not specified. In-store pickup is free.\nDELIVERY TIMEFRAME: The standard delivery time is 2-10 working days, Monday to Friday. \nNOTABLE FEATURES: Saturday delivery is possible but not guaranteed for major cities. There is no mention of express delivery or cash-on-delivery surcharges.\nRESTRICTIONS: Home delivery is not available to a significant number of island postal codes. For some other islands, delivery is limited to the ferry port. Deliveries to the historic centers of cities like Dubrovnik and Rovinj are also restricted.\nWEBSITE ASSESSMENT: The shipping information is available on a dedicated page but lacks some key details. While island delivery restrictions are clearly listed, the absence of a price list before checkout and no mention of specific courier partners makes it difficult for customers to compare options. Information for bulky items is not separately detailed but is covered under the general weight-based pricing."
