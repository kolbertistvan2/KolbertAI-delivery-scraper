  "SUMMARY": "DELIVERY OPTIONS: dm.hr offers home delivery, DPD Pickup Point (parcel shop) delivery, and in-store pickup (standard and express) within Croatia.\nPROVIDERS: The exclusive delivery partner is DPD.\nPRICING: Standard delivery for all methods is €3.95. Delivery is free for registered 'Moj dm' account holders for orders over €49.\nRESTRICTIONS: Delivery is only within Croatia. Delivery times to certain locations, likely islands, may be longer than the standard 2-3 working days. Delivery is not made on weekends or holidays, except for in-store pickup which depends on store hours.\nNOTABLE FEATURES: An 'Express In-Store Pickup' service is available, allowing customers to collect their order in 60 minutes. This service is free for registered users and costs €0.95 for guests.\nWEBSITE ASSESSMENT: The shipping information is located on a clear, dedicated page. It effectively outlines the available methods, standard costs, and delivery times. However, it lacks specific details on potential island surcharges (beyond time delays), cash-on-delivery fees, and any policies related to bulky or heavy items."
