  "SUMMARY": "DELIVERY OPTIONS: The primary delivery method is home delivery for all of Croatia. Customers can also redirect their packages to a parcel locker. There is no in-store pickup or parcel shop option. A separate process exists for bulky items.\nPROVIDERS: Standard deliveries are handled by GLS, DPD, and Paket 24 (Hrvatska pošta). Bulky items are delivered by a different, unnamed transport company.\nPRICING: There is a flat delivery fee of 5 Euros for all orders. No free shipping threshold is mentioned.\nRESTRICTIONS: Delivery is only within Croatia. The delivery timeframe is quite wide, from 1 to 21 business days. Bulky items (over 10kg or large dimensions) cannot be paid for with cash on delivery and must be prepaid.\nNOTABLE FEATURES: Customers have the option to redirect a home delivery shipment to a parcel locker. Payment at the parcel locker is possible by card.\nWEBSITE ASSESSMENT: Shipping information is not on a dedicated page but is embedded within the very long 'General Terms and Conditions' (Uvjeti kupnje) page, making it difficult to locate. The information lacks clarity on several points, such as the specific provider for bulky items, island delivery policies, and express options. There is no mention of a free shipping threshold, which is a common feature for e-commerce sites."
