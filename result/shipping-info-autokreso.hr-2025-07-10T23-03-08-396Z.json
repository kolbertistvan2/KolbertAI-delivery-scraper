  "SUMMARY": "DELIVERY OPTIONS: The primary delivery method is home delivery via Overseas Express. In-store pickup is available at a single location in Zagreb. Parcel shop pickup is also an option at Overseas Express Shops within Auro Domus branches.\nPRICING: Home delivery costs €5.50 for orders below €80 and is free for orders of €80 or more. Pricing for pickup options is not specified.\nDELIVERY TIMES & RESTRICTIONS: Standard delivery is within 24 hours on the mainland. Island deliveries may take up to 3 working days depending on the courier's schedule. Weekend deliveries are not available.\nNOTABLE FEATURES: The website offers a clear free shipping threshold. It provides an alternative pickup option at parcel shops, which is a recent addition. Detailed delivery conditions for islands are outsourced to the courier's website.\nWEBSITE ASSESSMENT: The shipping information is consolidated on a dedicated 'Dostava i isporuka' page and is generally clear. However, it lacks details on COD surcharges, express options, and specific costs for pickup services. The information is sufficient for a standard mainland delivery but requires customers to seek external information for island deliveries."
