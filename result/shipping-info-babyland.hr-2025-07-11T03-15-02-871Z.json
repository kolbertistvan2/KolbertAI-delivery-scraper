  "SUMMARY": "DELIVERY OPTIONS: Babyland.hr provides home delivery for both standard and bulky items across Croatia. There is no mention of parcel shop, parcel locker, or in-store pickup options.\nPROVIDERS: Delivery is handled by HP, GLS, Overseas, and DPD.\nPRICING: Standard delivery is free for orders over 55 EUR, otherwise it costs 4 EUR. A cash on delivery (COD) option is available for standard orders with a 0.90 EUR surcharge. Bulky item delivery, such as furniture, incurs a fixed 20 EUR handling fee.\nNOTABLE FEATURES: A key restriction applies to the delivery of bulky items (furniture) to Croatian islands; these are delivered only to the nearest mainland distribution center, not directly to the island address. Furthermore, cash on delivery is not an option for bulky/palletized shipments.\nWEBSITE ASSESSMENT: The shipping information is available on a dedicated 'Dostava & povrati' page. While the core details are present, the information could be better structured by clearly separating the rules for standard parcels from those for bulky goods. The lack of information on alternative delivery methods like pickup points or lockers is a notable omission."
