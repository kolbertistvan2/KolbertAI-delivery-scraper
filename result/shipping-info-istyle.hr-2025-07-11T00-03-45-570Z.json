  "SUMMARY": "DELIVERY OPTIONS: The primary delivery methods are standard home delivery across Croatia and same-day express delivery in Zagreb and Rijeka. In-store pickup is also available at their physical locations. \nPROVIDERS: Standard delivery is handled by DPD, while same-day delivery is managed by Locodels. \nPRICING: Standard delivery costs 3,95 €, with free shipping on orders over 80 €. Same-day delivery is a flat rate of 9 €. Pricing for in-store pickup is not specified. \nRESTRICTIONS: Deliveries are only made on weekdays (Monday-Friday). Delivery to islands may take 1-2 extra days, and there are current noted delays for Istria and the islands of Vis, Brač, Hvar, and Krk. Same-day delivery is contingent on the product being in stock at the local store and the order being placed by 14:00. \nNOTABLE FEATURES: The availability of same-day delivery in Zagreb and Rijeka is a key service. The free shipping threshold is clearly defined at 80 €. \nWEBSITE ASSESSMENT: The shipping information is located on a dedicated 'Dostava i preuzimanje' page and is generally clear and well-organized. It clearly outlines costs, timelines, and providers for standard and express services. However, it lacks information on COD surcharges, bulky item shipping, and options for parcel shops or lockers."
