  "SUMMARY": "DELIVERY OPTIONS: The webshop offers home delivery across Croatia and free personal pickup at their Zagreb location. \nPRICING: Home delivery costs 5€ for orders up to 300€ and is free for orders over 300€. Personal pickup is free. \nPROVIDERS: Specific courier companies are not named; the site refers to them generally as 'transport companies'. \nDELIVERY TIME: Standard delivery takes 1-3 working days, extending up to 5 working days for islands. \nNOTABLE FEATURES: A detailed delivery schedule for major Croatian islands is provided, including some Saturday deliveries. For bulky or heavy items of low value, a custom delivery price is calculated and communicated to the customer. Delivery to islands not on the main schedule must be specially arranged and will incur extra charges. \nWEBSITE ASSESSMENT: The shipping information is presented on a dedicated page and is mostly clear and comprehensive. Key details like pricing tiers, delivery times, and island delivery specifics are well-defined. However, the page lacks information on the specific courier services used, express delivery options, and any potential cash-on-delivery surcharges."
