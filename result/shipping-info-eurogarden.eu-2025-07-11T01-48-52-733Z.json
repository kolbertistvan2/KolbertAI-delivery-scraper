  "SUMMARY": "SUMMARY: Eurogarden.eu offers home delivery to Croatia for standard and bulky items via Post of Slovenia and GLS. Standard delivery pricing is based on order value, costing €8.20 for orders up to €99.99 and €6.56 for orders between €100 and €149.99 (prices exclude VAT). Bulky item delivery (over 25kg) is priced based on weight, ranging from €5.74 to over €90.16 (excl. VAT). Deliveries are made on weekdays until 4 pm. Parcel shop, parcel locker, and in-store pickup options are not mentioned. Information on delivery timeframes, island surcharges, and cash on delivery is not available. NOTABLE FEATURES: A mandatory first start-up test is performed on certain machines (e.g., Husqvarna) before delivery. WEBSITE ASSESSMENT: The website provides detailed pricing tables but lacks crucial information such as delivery timeframes, free shipping thresholds for Croatia, island delivery policies, and COD options. All prices are listed excluding VAT, which may not be immediately clear to the end consumer."
