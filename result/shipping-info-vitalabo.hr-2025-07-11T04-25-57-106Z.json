  "SUMMARY": "DELIVERY OPTIONS: The webshop offers standard home delivery, express delivery, bulky item delivery via forwarding agent, and pickup at Austrian Post parcel shops/lockers. \nPRICING & PROVIDERS: Standard delivery costs €6.90 and is free for orders over €49.90, handled by Austrian Post and Slovenian Post. Express delivery is available via DHL Express with prices starting at €16.50, depending on weight. Other listed providers include DPD and Fedex Economy. \nNOTABLE FEATURES: Packages are shipped from Austria, which may affect delivery times during Austrian public holidays. Special delivery options for bulky, refrigerated, or items requiring special handling are available with additional costs specified on product pages. Cash on delivery is listed as a payment method, but no surcharge is mentioned. \nWEBSITE ASSESSMENT: The shipping information is comprehensive and clearly presented on a dedicated page. It details costs, providers, and delivery times for different services. The main gap is the lack of information on potential island surcharges and cash on delivery fees. Overall, the information is of high quality and easy to access."
