  "SUMMARY": "DELIVERY OPTIONS: Maras.hr offers free home delivery within Croatia and free in-store pickup. PROVIDERS: Home delivery is handled by GLS, with Hrvatska Pošta used for certain islands and remote locations (Zone 2). PRICING: All delivery options are free, with no minimum order value mentioned. RESTRICTIONS: Delivery takes up to 10 working days, with potential delays for islands. A 10kg weight limit and longer transit times (48-168 hours) apply to Zone 2 locations. No express or weekend delivery is available. Parcel shop and locker delivery are not offered. NOTABLE FEATURES: Free shipping on all orders is a significant benefit. The company provides a detailed list of islands with specific delivery schedules and another list for locations with service restrictions. WEBSITE ASSESSMENT: Shipping information is very detailed and transparent but is located within the general Terms and Conditions page. A separate, easily accessible summary page would improve user experience, but all necessary information is present and clearly explained."
