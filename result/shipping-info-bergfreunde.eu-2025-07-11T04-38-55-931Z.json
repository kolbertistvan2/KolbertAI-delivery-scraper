  "SUMMARY": "DELIVERY OPTIONS: Home delivery is the only method offered for Croatia. Delivery of bulky/special items is available but may take longer.\nPROVIDERS: DHL is the specified shipping partner.\nPRICING: Standard shipping costs €9.95 for orders up to €100. A free shipping threshold is not explicitly mentioned for Croatia, unlike for other countries. No separate pricing for bulky items is listed.\nRESTRICTIONS: No specific delivery restrictions for Croatian islands are mentioned. Cash on delivery is not an available payment method.\nNOTABLE FEATURES: The website does not offer express delivery, weekend delivery, parcel shop/locker delivery, or in-store pickup for Croatia.\nWEBSITE ASSESSMENT: The shipping information is presented in a clear table, but key details for Croatia are missing. Specifically, the free shipping threshold is not stated, and delivery timeframes are not provided on the page, requiring customers to visit the DHL website for more information. The lack of information on alternative delivery methods like parcel points is a notable omission."
