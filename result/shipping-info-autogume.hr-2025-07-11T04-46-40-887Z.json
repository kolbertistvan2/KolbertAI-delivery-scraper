  "SUMMARY": "DELIVERY OPTIONS: The primary method is home delivery throughout Croatia, including islands. It is also possible to have items delivered to a Croatian Post office (ured Hrvatske pošte).\nPROVIDERS: Specific courier companies are not named; the site refers to a generic 'delivery service' (dostavna služba).\nPRICING: Shipping is charged per item, with costs varying by product type and size (e.g., standard car tires €4.99, larger tires €6.99). A minimum delivery cost of €9.98 applies to every order. There is no free shipping threshold mentioned.\nNOTABLE FEATURES: Delivery to Croatian islands and the Dubrovnik-Neretva region is explicitly supported but incurs a longer delivery time of an additional 2-5 working days. The base delivery time for any item is displayed on its product page.\nWEBSITE ASSESSMENT: The shipping cost information is detailed and transparent, broken down by product category. However, the site lacks crucial details such as the names of their delivery partners, and any information regarding express delivery, weekend delivery, or cash-on-delivery surcharges. The information is sufficient for calculating costs but incomplete regarding service options."
