  "SUMMARY": "DELIVERY OPTIONS: The primary delivery method is home delivery via the GLS courier service. In-store pickup is also available at their numerous physical locations across Croatia. Parcel shop and parcel locker delivery options are not offered.\nPRICING: Home delivery costs 4,00 € for orders under 50,00 €, while orders of 50,00 € or more qualify for free shipping. A surcharge of 1,00 € applies for cash on delivery (COD) payments. The cost for in-store pickup is not specified.\nDELIVERY TIME & RESTRICTIONS: The standard delivery timeframe is 2-5 business days. For Croatian islands, delivery is subject to the GLS schedule, which may lead to delays. Express and weekend delivery services are not available.\nNOTABLE FEATURES: The company offers a clear free shipping threshold and a single, straightforward delivery partner. The availability of in-store pickup in many cities is a significant advantage.\nWEBSITE ASSESSMENT: Shipping information is not on a dedicated page but is clearly outlined within the 'Uvjeti Plaćanja' (Terms of Payment) section. While functional, a separate 'Dostava' (Delivery) page would improve user experience. Information is concise and covers the essential details for standard home delivery."
