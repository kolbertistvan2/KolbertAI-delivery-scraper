  "SUMMARY": "DELIVERY OPTIONS: The webshop offers home delivery for standard and bulky items, as well as in-store pickup. Parcel shop and parcel locker delivery are not mentioned.\nPROVIDERS: Specific delivery service providers (e.g., GLS, DPD) are not named.\nPRICING: Standard home delivery costs €7 for orders under €65 and is free for orders above this amount. Bulky items like bicycles, e-bikes, and trainers have a fixed shipping fee of €55, while ski boots cost €25 to ship; the free shipping threshold does not apply to these items. In-store pickup is available and appears to be free.\nRESTRICTIONS: Delivery is available throughout Croatia, but may take longer for certain islands. Cash on delivery is an option for orders up to €1600.\nNOTABLE FEATURES: The standard delivery time is up to 4 working days, but a prominent notice indicates a temporary extension to 13 working days due to a warehouse relocation. Bicycles are shipped after a professional service but require minor final assembly by the customer.\nWEBSITE ASSESSMENT: The shipping information is located within the comprehensive 'Terms of Purchase' page. While detailed, it lacks a quick, user-friendly summary. The absence of named delivery providers is a notable omission. However, the pricing structure is clear, and the temporary delivery delay is transparently communicated."
