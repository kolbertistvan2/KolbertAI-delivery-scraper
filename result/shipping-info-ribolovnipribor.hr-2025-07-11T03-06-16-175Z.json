  "SUMMARY": "DELIVERY OPTIONS: Home delivery and in-store pickup are available. Parcel shop and locker delivery are not mentioned.\nPROVIDERS: Croatian Post and GLS are the main providers for domestic delivery. DHL is also listed as an option.\nPRICING: Home delivery pricing is based on weight, starting from 4,00€ with Croatian Post and 5,50€ with GLS. Free shipping is offered on orders over 40,00€ via Croatian Post. In-store pickup pricing is not specified.\nRESTRICTIONS: There is no information about island surcharges. For items with large volumetric weight, customers will be contacted for possible extra costs.\nNOTABLE FEATURES: Cash on delivery is available for a surcharge of 5,92. Saturday delivery is possible for an additional 50% of the shipping cost. Orders placed by 13:00h are shipped the same day.\nWEBSITE ASSESSMENT: The shipping information is available on a dedicated page but is somewhat fragmented between text paragraphs and tables. Pricing for different weight brackets is clearly laid out in tables. Information on bulky items, express delivery, and island surcharges is missing or vague. The COD surcharge is listed, but the currency is not explicitly stated, though it is likely EUR."
