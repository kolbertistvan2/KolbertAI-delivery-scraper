  "SUMMARY": "DELIVERY OPTIONS: The only available delivery option for Croatia is home delivery. There is no mention of parcel lockers, parcel shops, or in-store pickup.\nPROVIDERS: Delivery is handled by DPD or Hrvatska pošta (post).\nPRICING: Delivery costs €3.32 for packages up to 2kg and €3.98 for packages from 2kg to 25kg. Shipping is free for all orders over €29.00.\nDELIVERY TIME: Standard delivery time is 1-3 working days, which may be extended to 5-7 working days or more during sales periods.\nNOTABLE FEATURES: Cash on delivery is available as a payment method for orders within Croatia, with no specific surcharge mentioned. There is no information about express delivery, weekend delivery, or any surcharges for delivering to Croatian islands.\nWEBSITE ASSESSMENT: The shipping information for Croatia is clearly laid out on the 'Payment and Delivery' page. Pricing tiers and the free shipping threshold are easy to understand. However, the page lacks details on island delivery, express options, and weekend services. It also doesn't specify how the choice between DPD and the post is made."
