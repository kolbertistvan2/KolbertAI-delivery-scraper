  "SUMMARY": "Mömax.hr provides home delivery throughout Croatia, with distinct services for standard parcels and bulky (cargo) items. Standard parcel delivery costs €3.90 via DPD, while bulky item delivery is €26.50 via Gebrüder Weiss. All deliveries are free for orders exceeding €530.00. The standard delivery timeframe is 3-10 working days, Monday to Friday. A surcharge of €9.20 applies to all island deliveries. Customers can also opt for free in-store pickup or redirect DPD parcels to one of 840 partner pickup locations (parcel shops). \nNOTABLE FEATURES: The company uses DPD for parcels and Gebrüder Weiss for bulky goods. Bulky items are delivered to the curbside, but in-home delivery can be arranged for an additional fee by contacting customer service. There is no weekend or express delivery option. \nWEBSITE ASSESSMENT: The shipping information is well-organized and detailed on a dedicated page. It clearly differentiates between parcel and cargo shipping, providing costs, providers, and delivery times for each. The inclusion of information on island surcharges, in-store pickup, and parcel shop redirection is helpful. However, details on COD surcharges and a list of store locations for pickup are not available on the page."
