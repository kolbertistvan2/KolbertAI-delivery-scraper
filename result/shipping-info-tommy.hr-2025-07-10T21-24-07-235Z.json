  "SUMMARY": "DELIVERY OPTIONS: Tommy offers standard and express home delivery in partnership with Wolt and Glovo. Delivery is limited to specific cities: Split, Šibenik, Zadar, Rijeka, Zagreb, and Dubrovnik. Other options like in-store pickup, parcel shops/lockers, or bulky item delivery are not mentioned.\nPRICING & TIMES: Standard delivery costs 2,65 € (free over 55 €) and offers same-day delivery for orders before noon, Monday-Saturday. Express delivery costs 2,65 € (free over 55 €) and arrives within 30-50 minutes, Monday-Saturday. Minimum order values apply.\nRESTRICTIONS: Delivery is geographically limited. There is no information regarding island delivery or potential surcharges. Cash on delivery is available for standard service but not for express.\nNOTABLE FEATURES: Same-day and express delivery options are key services. Partnership with major delivery platforms Wolt and Glovo.\nWEBSITE ASSESSMENT: The shipping information is located on a dedicated 'Dostava' page and is clear and concise. It effectively explains the available home delivery services. However, it lacks information on other common delivery methods and does not address delivery to Croatian islands, which is a significant omission for a national retailer."
