  "SUMMARY": "AEG.cz provides home delivery across the Czech Republic with three service levels: Standard (to the first door), Premium (in-home delivery, unpacking), and Standard Balíček (for small packages). Delivery is free for all orders over 500 Kč. Standard delivery is typically the next working day for orders placed before 12:00, while Premium delivery takes 1-3 working days. All deliveries occur on weekdays (Monday-Friday). Cash on delivery is an option for orders up to 50,000 Kč, but no surcharge is specified. The website does not mention any options for delivery to parcel shops, parcel lockers, or for in-store pickup. \nNOTABLE FEATURES: The Premium delivery service is well-suited for large appliances, including unpacking and removal of packaging. A wide range of paid installation services for different appliances (washing machines, ovens, etc.) is available. The company also offers free take-back of old appliances. \nWEBSITE ASSESSMENT: The shipping information is located on a dedicated page and is generally clear, especially regarding the different tiers of home delivery service. However, it fails to name the specific courier companies used and does not state the shipping cost for orders under the 500 Kč free shipping threshold. The absence of information on pickup points or lockers suggests these methods are not supported."
