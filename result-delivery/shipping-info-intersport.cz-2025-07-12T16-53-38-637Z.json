  "SUMMARY": "DELIVERY OPTIONS: Intersport.cz provides home delivery, parcel shop/locker delivery, and in-store pickup. PROVIDERS: The primary carrier is PPL for both home and pickup point deliveries, with AlzaBox as a partner for parcel lockers. PRICING: Home delivery costs 85 Kč, and parcel point delivery costs 55 Kč. Free shipping is offered on all orders over 1,500 Kč. In-store pickup is always free. RESTRICTIONS: Shipping is only available within the Czech Republic. Bulky items like bicycles and skis cannot be delivered to a home address and must be picked up at an Intersport store. NOTABLE FEATURES: In-store pickup for bikes and skis is free and includes initial setup and service. PPL drivers are equipped with payment terminals, allowing for card payment upon delivery. WEBSITE ASSESSMENT: The shipping information is located on a single, well-organized page. It clearly outlines the available methods, providers, and costs. However, it lacks specific details regarding COD surcharges, express options, and weekend delivery capabilities."
