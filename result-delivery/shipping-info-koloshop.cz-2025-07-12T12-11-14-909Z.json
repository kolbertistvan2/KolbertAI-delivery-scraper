  "SUMMARY": "Koloshop.cz provides several delivery options within Czechia. Standard home delivery is handled by PPL, Balíkovna na adresu, and DHL. Parcel shop and locker services are available through Zásilkovna, PPL Parcelshop, and Balíkovna. In-store pickup is an option at their four physical stores in Praha, Teplice, Brno, and Liberec. Pricing for standard parcels starts from 50 Kč, with free shipping on orders over 2,000 Kč for most services (DHL requires 10,000 Kč). Bulky items like bicycles have a separate price list, starting at 150 Kč, with free shipping thresholds between 30,000 Kč and 50,000 Kč depending on the bike type; e-bikes and bazaar bikes do not qualify for free shipping. NOTABLE FEATURES: A flat COD surcharge of 25 Kč applies to deliveries. In-store pickup is free in Teplice and costs 19 Kč in other cities (waived for orders over 2,000 Kč). Weekend pickup is possible on Saturdays at their physical stores. WEBSITE ASSESSMENT: The shipping information is clearly presented on a dedicated page with easy-to-understand tables for pricing and services. The data is comprehensive regarding costs and providers. However, information on delivery timeframes and specific express delivery options is missing."
