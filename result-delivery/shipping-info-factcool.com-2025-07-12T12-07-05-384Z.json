  "SUMMARY": "DELIVERY OPTIONS: Factcool provides home delivery and parcel shop/locker delivery. The available providers are SPS and Packeta. PRICING: Home delivery costs 3.49 € (SPS) or 3.99 € (Packeta). Parcel shop/locker delivery costs 2.49 € (SPS) or 2.99 € (Packeta). Free shipping is offered on orders over 69 € when using SPS services. A cash on delivery (COD) option is available for a surcharge of 1.99 €. RESTRICTIONS: Information on delivery times, express delivery, and weekend delivery is not provided. The available information is for Slovakia but is expected to be similar for Czechia.\nNOTABLE FEATURES: The key feature is the free shipping threshold at 69 € for all SPS delivery methods. Packeta delivery is always a paid service. COD is consistently priced across all available options.\nWEBSITE ASSESSMENT: The shipping information is presented in a clear and simple table, making it easy to compare costs between providers and delivery types based on the order value. However, the page lacks crucial details such as estimated delivery timeframes and information on special delivery services like express or weekend options. The information appears to be for the Slovak market, which may cause confusion for customers in other countries."
