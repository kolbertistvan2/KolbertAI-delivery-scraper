  "SUMMARY": "DELIVERY OPTIONS: Košík.cz exclusively offers home delivery via its own courier service. There are no options for parcel shops, parcel lockers, or in-store pickup.\nPRICING: Delivery pricing starts from 29 Kč and varies based on the delivery address and selected time slot. Free delivery is offered on large purchases and for new customers for their first 60 days. Cheaper 'Eko' delivery slots are also available.\nDELIVERY SPEED: Same-day delivery is possible. Customers can choose specific 30-minute or 1-hour delivery windows. For a small surcharge, a 'velkopřesné' (very precise) 30-minute delivery slot can be booked.\nNOTABLE FEATURES: The service features live online tracking of the courier on a map. They offer 'Eko' (eco-friendly) delivery slots, which are cheaper and have a lower carbon footprint. The exact delivery cost is only shown after entering an address and selecting a time slot.\nWEBSITE ASSESSMENT: The website provides a good general overview of its delivery service but lacks a single, detailed price list. Specific costs are personalized and shown during the checkout process, which requires user input (address). Information about other common delivery methods (parcel shops, lockers) is absent as the service is not offered."
